For this project, we had to create a manifesto based on some philosophical ideas. I chose to make one based on biblical ideas, Martin Luther King Jr., and some XVI-XVII century european philosohpers.

While **this manifesto is not my final thoughts on these matters**, and I would certainly like to revisit them at some point to clean some rough edges and to review if I still fill the same about this topics, I believe it can serve as a first impression of how I feel and behave regarding this topics at this point in time.

## Josué A. Bouchard's Manifesto (Spring 2024)

### How to live a good life

> A good life is a life surrendered to Jesus Christ. To live a good life is to live one which follows the example set by Jesus.

Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in his "Letter from Birmingham Jail", expressed his dislike that "[…] so many ministers say, 'Those [black people segregation] are social issues with which the Gospel has no real concern,' […]", making a distinction between "the sacred and the secular". The gospel is not a book to read only on Sundays but to be applied in our day to day.

I believe that "[…] everyone who hears these words of mine and puts them into practice is like a wise man who built his house on the rock. But everyone who hears these words of mine and does not put them into practice is like a foolish man who built his house on sand" (Matthew 7:24,26 ESV).

In that sense, I believe in Divine Command, that God defines what's good or bad. But the Bible also teaches that "God is not man […] that he should change his mind […]" (Numbers 23:19).

The Sermon on the Mount (Mathew 5-7), becomes one of the most excellent sources, influencing historical figures from MLK Jr. to Gandhi. Some of its call to action, in which I believe, include:
-	We should not be mediocre but enhance the world in which we live. Not hiding those gifts that are on us but using them.
-	Don't let anger control you, but rather settle it quickly.
-	Don't look lustfully at others.
-	Love your enemies, even praying for them.
-	Don't judge others if you don't want to be judged.
-	So much more…

### The treatment of others

> We should treat others with practical love. Love is not an emotion, but a decision.

Drawing from the previous point, Jesus on the Sermon on the Mount teaches that we should not only "love your neighbor", but also "love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you" (Mathew 5:43-44). This calls us to get out of our comfort zone and extend love not only to those who did us good, but even to those who wrong us.

Love is not an emotion, but rather a decision, as is forgiveness. Love in this case is not the one in the platonic sense, but the respect and care for others, understanding that we are all loved by God and that all have sinned against God, so no one can boast.

### Human's place in the world/environment

> We should rule over nature, manage natural resources wisely, taking care of what we've been given, and leave a better place than the one we came to.

We should rule over nature, as in Genesis 1:28-29 God gave us everything on Earth under our dominion. That doesn't mean that we can abuse it and destroy it without consequences, but nothing should be out of our reach, for everything is for our use.

The part on managing natural resources (and all kinds of resources) will be addressed in a later section.

I believe that it is not sufficient to leave the world as it was when we came to it, but we should strive to improve it. In that regard, I agree with the Technocentrism value system, that technology could be useful to "address ecological problems", improve efficiency and management.

We should rule over nature, manage properly the natural resources, and using technology and all sort of tools and abilities to improve the environment.

### The role of leaders in governing people

> Leaders should be an example for those under their command. There should be checks on the power of the rulers.

Even if Jesus's divinity was not recognized, the Bible depicts him as a teacher who lived a life according to the principles he thought. That's one great example of leadership. MLK Jr., Ghandi, and many other influential leaders have also lived their lives according to the principles they though. That's, in my opinion, the way leadership should be carried out.

While morality should play a great role in governance, one must recognize that in this world there are also unethical people and we must set appropriate mechanisms to deal with that.

Montesquieu in his essay "The Spirit of the Law", states that "power should be checked by power", introducing the idea of separation of powers, and the system of checks and balances. His main contribution was the idea of oversight of power by power.

John Locke would add to that in his "Second Treatise of Government", Chapter XIII, sect. 149, where he says that the power belongs to the people, and if the leader goes against the agreed ends, the people should have the ability to reclaim the power and change the leader.
Equality and freedom

Freedom is of the utmost importance, but equality will demand to give power to someone. The government should be in charge of reconciling these two ideas.

By government, I don't necessarily mean the national or federal governments, but an institution or set of people.

Jean-Jacques Rousseau in "The Social Contract" laid the foundations for the idea of the social contract, where people willingly decide to give their freedom to a ruler, in exchange for protection and other benefits. This is needed to channel the general will of the people, and in turn, enforce the laws that will ensure equality for everyone.

However, similar to Locke's ideas, Rousseau states the idea that the ultimate authority is still on the people and that if the ruler betrays the ends, the ruler can and should be replaced by another, and in the meantime, the power returns to the people.

As a practical step, we should submit to a ruler as long as this ensures the end we are looking for, which in this case is equality. If the ruler betrays this idea, we should be able to reclaim our power, be it in elections, through non-violent demonstrations, or other means.

### Distribution of resources

> Resources should be distributed fairly based on merit while taking care of those in need.

The principle of stewardship is a biblical principle that states that we should manage the resources that God has given us, make good use of them, and multiply them to the best of our abilities.

I believe that we should distribute the resources fairly, giving everyone equal opportunities, and later entrusting them to multiply what has been given. However, special care should be taken with those in need. I believe that while people in need may not deserve it because of their abilities, they should still be helped whenever possible, for "It is more blessed to give than to receive" (Acts 20:35).
We should make good use of what's entrusted to us, distribute resources fairly, and help those in need.

This project has been really interesting, as it made you think on many problems which usually don't have a clear answer. In many cases, such as in the distribution of resources, I found myself torn apart between many different interests. It was pretty hard to try to summarize a complex position in a series of practical steps. However, seeing it finished, I find it a nice way to begin the dialogue, and a good place to revisit at some point in the future.
