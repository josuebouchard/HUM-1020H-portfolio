For this project, we've been tasked to read William Shakespeare's "Twelfth Night", and create an adaptation as if it were a modern comedy, while still retaining some aspects of the original story. We decided to remake one of the final scenes of the book in something like a sitcom.

This was my first *group work* in an online class, so it was interesting to have to collaborate with other people again, trying to coordinate a time for recording (as at that moment I was still in Argentina, with two hours of difference with respect to Orlando), and organizing the script.
