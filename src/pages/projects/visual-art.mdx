For this project, I had to create an original art piece, based on a two-dimensional visual art from the [Rollins Museum of Art](https://www.rollins.edu/rma/) at Rollins College in Winter Park. In my case, I chose to do the [virtual tour](https://my.matterport.com/show/?m=vT9Dg7MowKx).

My inspiration was "Boats on the Hudson" (1841), by Elizabeth Emmett Leroy.

With that inspiration, I created my own piece of art, "No Place Like Home" (2024), by Josu√© A. Bouchard.

The medium is digital art, though I attempted to make it look like it's oil painting. It was created using **Artificial Intelligence**. In the foreground, you can see four brigs or caravels, all facing right at least to some degree, and a green portion of land with some houses on the right, and some hills and vegetation in the background. Everything is illuminated from above by the sunset and light bouncing out of the water. For the colors, the warm colors of the sun, the boats with their sails, the houses, and the water, contrast with the cool colors of the hills in the background and the patches of sky further from the sun. As this attempts to recreate an oil paint, the strokes are very noticeable and it seems as if there were a lot of layers of paint. In the sky, the strokes are longer and wider, while in the water they are more blended and sometimes more fine or controlled. For the lines, they are smooth and curvy in most parts. The most notable shapes are triangles formed by the ships and their sails, the sort of semi-circle formed by the land, and the pentagons for the houses.

It was created using the following prompt:

> A detailed oil painting of two or three small caravelts, brings and sailboats, arriving at a port at sunset. Make it look like an oil painting from 1841. It must have warm tones, contrasting with cool colors for the sky. The strokes must be smooth so the details can be seen. Must include the port, a place to tow the ships, and a small piece of green land with some hills and some scattered houses.

This piece attemps to simulate the *romanticism* genre (even though those ships wouldn't have existed at that time). In theory, this belongs to the *digital art* genre. The romantic movement existed between the 18th and 19th centuries, mainly in Europe. The movement was characterized by its emphasis on emotion and individualism as well as glorification of the past and nature, preferring the medieval over the classical. In this case, nature and emotion are two main components of this piece, and realism though looked at, is not of the utmost importance, which makes me believe it shouldn't be classified as realism.

This project taught me that me several things. First of all, it was the first time I used AI to create a complex piece of art, with specific ideas and thoughts. Second, the prompt helped me to learn some characteristics of the romanticism genre, such as the use of oil painting, the bright colors, the size of the strokes, and the depth of the piece (the things at the foreground, middleground, and background).
