For this project we had to create an original song. This is my original song, **Staying Afloat**.

<audio controls class="w-full">

The melody (only the first part) was made by me when I was around 8 years old. It was first officially made in an 8-bit version for a video game I made with my father in 48 hours called [Submarine Defense](https://cotuex.itch.io/submarine-defense). For this assignment, I made it more jazzy, dropped the 8-bit sine-wave synthesizer for a piano, and added a lot of new instruments to make it fit its new genre. This song was written from
scratch.

I wrote the scoresheet in Musescore 4, and then exported the music.

- **Tempo**: Presto (220 BPM)
- **Dynamics**: Mostly mezzo forte
- **Mood**: Happy
- **Texture**: Polyphonic
- **Structure and form**: The song is divided into two pieces and a small long fill for the intro, accompanied by the bass.
In the first part, the melody is carried by the piano, while the trumpet and the trombone only make arrangements. The first loop and the second loop of the first part have small differences in the arrangements of the trumpets.
In the second part, the trumpet relays the piano and carries the melody, while the trombone starts doing more of a marching rhythm. The piano has some contributions and at the end of the two loops, it starts making chords

This project was a really interesting experience. I loved how I got to learn more how to write music, how to mix instruments, and some musical resources. It was also pretty fun to see the project taking form, going from a scoresheet to the complete song.
