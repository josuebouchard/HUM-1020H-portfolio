For my cross-cultural experience I decided to participate of a virtual Jew Shabbat at [Congregation Ohev Shalom](https://www.ohevshalom.org/).

> Disclamer: I'm not a Jew, and for this experience I had no one guiding me.

>All the ideas reflect how I understood things with my little insight of Judaism. There might be errors or misunderstandings.

While most of my annotations are in my writing, some of the first things that came to my attention when I first began seeing the Shabbat, was how Jews sung the Torah. Being a Christian, from Baptist denomination, I would have never expected to hear part of our Bible sung.

While the beggining was confusing as I didn't have a guide, as soon as I began understanding the structure of a Shabbat, and began reading the Siddur Lev Shalem, I found it really interesting.

This experience has pushed to do something uncomfortable (though more tolerable from it being online and anonymous), and I found it to be a really interesting experience.
