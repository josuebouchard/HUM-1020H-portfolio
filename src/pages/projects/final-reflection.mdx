## Final reflection

Everything eventually must come to an end. HUM-1020H has been a course in which we have seen how the arts, the music, the philosophy, and other areas of the humanities have taken place in the world.

As with every time I have to summarize a big idea, this portfolio was an opportunity to rethink what I've done in the light of what I currently know. In the technical and design aspects, deciding to code the portfolio was a great exercise for me, and it allowed me to try new tools that will certainly help me in my professional life. While I was fearful in the beginning that it would be a lot of work and that I might not be able to finish on time, or that I may be wasting a lot of time, it ended up looking pretty clean, and I'm very satisfied with its look. On the content side of it, it was nice to review all my previous projects, now without the pressure of having to turn them in. The blog-style portfolio allowed me to expand on the projects, and add pictures, videos, music, and hyperlinks to other resources that were useful to me. As we've learned in this course, for art, context is key. And seeing all the projects in one place, easily accessible, makes it look nice as if they were trophies on a shelf.

In this course, we've studied the humanities. For me, it could be summarized as “all the ways humans have to express themselves, their individuality as much as their collectiveness”. That included a not-so-brief journey through philosophy, sculpturing, art, music, philosophy, architecture, and history of different times, and how those people used it to express themselves. I've learned how different methods of expression can be associated with different times, and the context in which they were developed.

The theme that accompanied us all semester was “Get Out”. Professor Woldman introduced us to it during our first class. We associated it with ideas such as abandoning the comfort zone, pursuing something new, assuming creative risks, and trying out new ideas, basically, all ideas related to some sort of newfound freedom.

Being “Get out” the theme that would connect all of our works, I loved that it pushed us to explore new things. Personally, I interpreted it in that sense, to get out of my comfort zone, and pursue new things. Being more of a technical background, when I saw that this was a project-based class and that most of the projects were related to creating art pieces, I was not sure I would be able to be on par with what the class required. However, after the first projects, I gained enough confidence to double down on the projects.

I believe that in this class my biggest weaknesses has been my incapacity to make beauty with my hands. It's only needed to compare my AI-generated art project or my original song project with my original sculpture project. Though I did my best effort, I must recognize that I'm not a great visual artist. Another weakness I had in this course, was that for the vast majority of the course, I was abroad in Argentina, my home country. While the course was online, and the professor made all the arrangements possible so that we could have virtual options for the field experience, the cross-cultural experience, and all other projects, it certainly brought some difficulties, especially at the moment of coordinating group projects with my fellows. 

However, my strengths helped me to stay afloat. I believe that the most useful one was perseverance. No matter how hard I found a task, or whether or not it was of my liking, I understood from day one that I would have to make the most I could of this course, enjoying the most I could, making friends, learning the most, and doing the projects to the best of my abilities. Another strength that helped me has been my good relationship with technology. Especially for online classes, the capability to solve problems on the fly, knowing the best tools for writing, editing, generating content with AI, and communicating, have been essential.

As I have already stated, I'm not a connoisseur of the arts, nor someone who would like to dedicate a big portion of time to learning it. However, I really enjoyed the moments we talked about history, politics, philosophy, and music. I'd love to delve deeper into those areas, especially music. I loved when we began to analyze the classical composers such as Mozart and Beethoven, or when we analyzed the different forms of music, such as the concerto and the cantatas.

All in all, this course has been an excellent experience, and has really made me enjoy taking it as an honors course. At the beginning of the semester, being this my first semester in the honors college, I was not sure what to expect. But it has certainly surprised me for good.

On a final note, I wanted to thank Professor Woldman for accompanying us on this course.
