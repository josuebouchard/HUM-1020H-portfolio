For the field experience, I did the [virtual tour of the Musei Vaticani](https://www.museivaticani.va/content/museivaticani/en/collezioni/musei/tour-virtuali-elenco.html) (the Vatican Museums). I decided to explore the [Pauline Halls](https://www.museivaticani.va/content/museivaticani/en/collezioni/musei/tour-virtuale-sale-paoline.html), the [Sistine Halls](https://www.museivaticani.va/content/museivaticani/en/collezioni/musei/tour-virtuale-sale-sistine.html), and the [Alexandrine Hall](https://www.museivaticani.va/content/museivaticani/en/collezioni/musei/tour-virtuale-sala-alessandrina.html).

It was really interesting, as I could apply some of the concepts I learned at class to analyze the halls, and understand a little more of the artistic decisions of the halls.
