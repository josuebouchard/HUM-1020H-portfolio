For the student-led discussion I worked along with Andrew Tracz. Our topic was the *representation of people and images in Renaissance art*. We used as a guide the essay **"Ways of Seeing"**.

Andrew was a great teammate. In this project I learned that dividing and delimiting tasks, coordinating times at which each task must be completed, and then trusting in the other while still communicating to check if the other person is on track, is a greate way to do projects.
