The sculpture was created by me alone using a method of trial and error, cutting strips of plasticine, modeling into the different parts of the human (head, torso, arms, hands, hips, legs, and feet), and then stitching them using small pieces of toothpicks. In some parts, toothpicks were also used to add rigidity to the sculpture. As many pieces had to be made twice (left and right side), one of the techniques used for making copies more reliably and modeling small pieces consisted of making two parts as similar as possible not caring for length, trimming the excess, and at last fixing any visible mark. In that sense, it could be argued that both additive and subtractive techniques were used. I'd say its genre is modern art or even assembled sculpture.

This project was the first in the course. In the beginning I was hesitant about it, and was unsure if I would be able to create something interesting. While I'm still far from being an artist, I enjoyed it, and found some comfort in seeing a finished work: the first of many to come.
